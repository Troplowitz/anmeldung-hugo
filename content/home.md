### What is the *Anmeldung* and what do I need it for?

Every person permanently living in Germany must by law register with their local registration office. This process is called *Anmeldung*. It is also required to:

- Get a driving license
- Register a car
- Report income tax

### Who needs to register and when?

For foreigners, every stay longer than **3 months** is considered permanent and needs to be reported. This means that a permanent residence must be found within these 3 months (This can be a friend's house or hotel). If you change residences during this time, you should record the one where you have spent the most time.

 Once moved in to your new residence, you have generally **1 week** to book an *Anmeldung*  appointment (**2 weeks** in some states). Exceeding the time limit may land you with a fine.

### What does it cost?

In most cases the *Anmeldung* is free. However, since German federal states have their own process, there can be exceptions; such as Hamburg, which currently charges a fee of €12 per person or family.

### What do I need?

For a successful Anmeldung you will need:

-	The *Anmeldung* form for your city, completed in German
-	A confirmation form from your landlord, known as *Wohnungsgeberbestätigung* or *Vermieter-Bestätigung*, also completed in German
-	Your rental contract
-	Your passport
-	*If required:* your visa or residence permit
-	*If present:* marriage certificate, birth certificates of your children, divorce papers
-	Some cash for any processing fees. *Note: Credit cards may not be accepted*

 An alternative is our **Anmeldung Generator** service, which guides you through the process in English.

### What do I do next?

#### 1. Make an appointment at your registration office.

In most German states for the *Anmeldung* a visit at your responsible registration office is compulsory. If you are moving together with your family, all family members must attend this appointment. In most registration offices you can easily make an appointment online – just visit your city's website. You can choose any registration office in your city, so you can often get an appointment in the same day if you're willing to go a bit further out.

#### 2. Visit the registration office.

The visit at the registration office (*Einwohnermeldeamt*) is a quick and relatively simple operation provided you made an appointment in advance. The registration officer will check your passport and transfer both the completed forms into the system. You will then finally receive your *Meldebestätigung*, the confirmation of your residence.
