### What is the *Anmeldung* and what do I need it for?

Every person permanently living in Germany must by law register with their local registration office. This process is called *Anmeldung*. It is also required for many further bureaucratic matters, such as getting an internet or phone contract, registering a car or reporting income tax.

### Who needs to register and when?

After moving in to your new residence you've generally got **2 weeks** time to book an *Anmeldung* appointment. An exception occurs if you're staying as a foreign visitor for less than **3 months** (2 months in Berlin) or as a visitor with another German residence for less than **6 months**. This means that a permanent residence must be found within this time (This can also be a hotel or, with a sublease contract, a friend's house). Exceeding the time limits may land you with a fine of up to €1.000, however, goodwill claims are frequently reported.

### What does it cost?

In most cases the *Anmeldung* is free. However, since German federal states have their own process, there can be exceptions; such as Hamburg, which currently charges a fee of €12 per person or family.

### What do I need?

For a successful *Anmeldung* you will need:

-	The *Anmeldung* form for your city, completed in German
-	A confirmation form from your landlord, known as *Wohnungsgeberbestätigung* or *Vermieter-Bestätigung*, also completed in German
-	Your passport or German ID
-	*If present:* Your rental or sublease contract
-	*If required:* your visa or residence permit
-	*If present:* marriage certificate, birth certificates of your children, divorce papers
-	Some cash for any processing fees. *Note: Credit cards may not be accepted*

### What if I don't speak German?

Good news! We've translated a copy of the Berlin *Anmeldung* form for your convenience. The forms of other cities may differ slightly, but require mostly the same information.

### What do I do next?

#### 1. Make an appointment at your registration office.

In most German states for the *Anmeldung* a visit at the responsible registration office, mostly called *Kundenzentrum* or *Bezirksamt*, is compulsory. In most registration offices you can easily make an appointment online – just visit your city's website. Especially in Germany's bigger cities registration offices are often booked out for several months. Don't worry though since the simple booking within the 2 weeks time limit is considered timely manner. Also you can choose any registration office in your city, so choosing an office a bit further out might be helpful getting an appointment.

#### 2. Visit the registration office.

The visit at the registration office is a quick and relatively simple operation provided you made an appointment in advance. The registration officer will check your passport or ID and transfer both the completed forms into the system. You will then finally receive your *Meldebestätigung*, the confirmation of your residence.
