#### What is the *Anmeldung*?

The *Anmeldung* is the form to be completed when registering to live in Germany. It must be completed in German. It is compulsory to register your address in Germany when staying for more than 3 months.

#### What if I can't speak German?

There are some guides offered in English, such as <a href="http://english.welcome.hamburg.de/contentblob/2217292/0b9929a8b01b3f615bbf11a946265669/data/an-ummeldung-des-wohnsitzes-englische-ausfuellhilfe.pdf" target="blank">this one for Hamburg</a>. Note that this guide applies to the Hamburg *Anmeldung*, and so will only be useful for Hamburg residents.

Another option is to use the **Anmeldung Generator**. This service costs â‚¬5. You simply need to input your residence details, and a completed (in German) Anmeldung PDF will be emailed to you. You can then print this off and take it to your registration appointment.
