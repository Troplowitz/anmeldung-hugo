## First look – what is important to you?

When deciding on a bank, there are many factors to consider. This is made more difficult when opening a bank account in another country. We’ve had a close look at a variety of German banks suitable for foreigners. The best of those are compared below. Before you look at the options in depth, there are 2 important questions to answer:

### **Do you understand German?**

Unfortunately, German banks generally don’t support English. This means the selection is limited. However, there still exist a few great banks that fully support English.

### **Do you prefer a direct bank or a branch bank?**

**Direct banks** are banks without any physical branches. They only offer their services online or by phone. As a result, they are generally free to use. Direct banks offer basically all the same services as branch banks. If you don’t have any special banking requirements, this is probably the type for you.

**Branch banks** are those with physical branches you can go to. Their main advantage over direct banks is in-person customer service. This is useful if you require personal advice or specialised services.
